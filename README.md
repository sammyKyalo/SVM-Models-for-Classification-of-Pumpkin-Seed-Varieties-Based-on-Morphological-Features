# SVM-Models-for-Classification-of-Pumpkin-Seed-Varieties-Based-on-Morphological-Features
This work contributes to understanding how machine learning models can classify agricultural products based on their morphological features. The findings can benefit researchers, seed producers, and farmers in enhancing pumpkin seed production and quality, as well as developing new products and varieties.
As the researcher in this study, my work involved evaluating the morphological features of two important varieties of pumpkin seeds grown in Turkey, namely 'urgup_sivrisi' and 'cercevelik'. I used five different machine learning models, including logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor to classify the pumpkin seed varieties based on their morphological characteristics. Through my research, I found that the support vector machine model provided the best performance in predicting the pumpkin seed variety, and I employed this model in my work. I utilized the classification report provided by the support vector machine model to analyze the precision, recall, and f1-score of the model for each of the two classes (0 and 1), which enabled me to determine the accuracy of the model in predicting the correct class for each observation and its ability to identify most of the observations belonging to each class. My work has contributed greatly to the understanding of the use of machine learning models for the classification of agricultural products based on their morphological features. Moreover, the information generated from this study can be used by researchers, seed producers, and farmers to classify different varieties of pumpkin seeds, enhance the production and quality of pumpkin seeds, as well as develop new products and varieties of pumpkin seeds.
